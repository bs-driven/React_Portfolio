        Hello and thank you for taking the time to take a look at what I have here.
        I hope to work with a company that will allow me the chance to grow and learn.
        I hope I meet the basic quailfacation to be consider for a entry level postion within your company.
        All I ask is for is consideration, and a bit of patiences I'm a quick learner; yet there are time s I don't pick up on things as quickly as i would something else.
        For instance its taken me ^months just to learn to code to this degree and I intend to go much futher in due time.
        If your looking a young person eager to learn and go much further.
        I'll put this the eaasy way I can I am your man.  
        </p>
    </div>
