      <h1>Work Summary</h1>
      <p>
        As I mentioned earlier I am new to this field so my work history won't reflect anything special. 
        I'm coming from working in a warehouse as a forklift driver. 
        Which I've done for a few years now. 
        Before working as a forklift driver I was working as a insulation installer which I had done for a few years as well. 
        I worked as fence installer as well which I will openly admit to anyone was the hardest work I have ever done. 
        The man I worked for was a sub-contractor and only worked on metal/aluminum and chainlink fences. 
        I worked this job through a summer; pushing a portable genearator in a wheel-barrel is no easy task. 
        Nor is using post-diggers trying to make a hole 3 feet to 6 feet deep depending on how tall the fence is going to stand. 
        The hardest part I would say tho is having to break through underground rocks with post diggers and a steel rod. 
        Depending on what type of rock you got determines how long that one hole will take you. 
        If it were a slate rock you can break it by slamming the rod into the rock a few dozen times. 
        If you happen to come acroos something like boulder best bet would be to find the edges of it to dig around it or you are going to need some power equipment. 
        I was even a bartender for little while as well. 
        That can be fun I will admit but I don't think I was in the right environment nor at the right time. 
        Maybe I'm being a little judgemental when I say this I apologize before hand but I dont think as a man I could make a living strictly off tips. 
        Something to do as a second or third job sure. 
        But the way todays society is set I don't have the right features to draw in a crowd nor make them want to give me their money. 
        Don't get me wrong if I can be proven wrong about this I'll gladly take the challenege on I just dont see it happening is all.
